About YAWIK
===========

YAWIK offers a web based solution for managing job applications. Jobs ads can be entered or pushed to the system. 
The system assigns application forms to job ads. Applicants and Recruiters can connect to YAWIK using social 
networks.

**So what is YAWIK?**

YAWIK is a modular system for human resources. It can be used as a job board, as a simple data entry tool for job
openings or as an application management system. It should give applicants the opportunity to quickly and easily create
a Hire-Me-Page. Currently it is possible to integrate YAWIK into a corporate website by extending it with an own module
(see :ref:`customize`). On the long term it is designed to become a distributed system for connecting recruiters and
applicants.


YAWIK is a PHP web application. It's based on Laminas_ and mongo. The target group of YAWIK are companies
and candidates.

As started in 2013, YAWIK is quite new but stable enough to be used by aprox 20 companies to manage applications.

**Why do we do this?**

We believe that:

* Candidates should be able to easily apply to a job advertisement
* Candidates should have sovereignty over their application data
* Recruiters should be able to easily find candidates
* Open Source and Human Resources fits together

**How came YAWIK to be?**

YAWIK was initiated by Carsten Bleek, owner of "CROSS Solution". "CROSS Solution" was able to convince customers about
the YAWIK idea. An initial group of [sponsors](https://yawik.org/sponsoren/) was found, and YAWIK was born.
