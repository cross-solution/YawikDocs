FAQ: Customize Formulars
========================


Is it possible to use a certain list of locations?
--------------------------------------------------

Yes. Since 0.29 it is possible to customize forms.

The :ref:`Geo<geo>` module offers to Form Elements. ``LocationSelect``, which creates an autocomplete search fields for a location
and ``SimpleLocationSelect``, which can be used to create a select field with a certain list of locations.

Example

Company XY has branch offices in `Frankfurt`, `MÃ¼nchen` and `Stuttgart`. The HR People want to simply select one of the
location, if a job posting is created. This can be done by creating a config file :file:`jobs.baseform.global.php`
in the the `config/autoload` directory.

.. code-block:: sh

  <?php
  
  return [
      'options' => [
          'Jobs/BaseFieldsetOptions' => [
              'options' => [
                  'fields' => [
                      'geoLocation' => [
                          'type' => 'SimpleLocationSelect',
                          'options' => [
                              'value_options' => [
                                  '{"city":"Stuttgart","region":"Baden-Wuerttemberg","coordinates":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[9.17702,48.78232]}}' => 'Stuttgart',
                                  '{"city":"Frankfurt","region":"Hessen","coordinates":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[8.68212,50.11092]}}' => 'Frankfurt',
                              ],
                          ],
                          'attributes' => [
                              'data-searchbox' => '-1',
                              'data-placeholder' => 'please select',
                              'data-allowclear' => 'true',
                          ],
                      ],
                  ],
              ],
          ],
      ],
  ];
